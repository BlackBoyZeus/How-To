	<h1>How to Use Olympus Montage for Video Editing</h1>
	<p>If you want to create stunning video montages with ease, Olympus Montage is the perfect tool for you. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use it:</p>

	<h2>Step 1: Package Your Video</h2>
	<p>To begin, click on the "Upload Video" button. You can upload any video file of your choice.</p>

	<h2>Step 2: Select Video Type and Adjust Performance Settings</h2>
	<p>Next, select the type of video you wish to upload, whether it's a soccer game, basketball match, video game playthrough, or an event recap. Then, adjust the performance settings according to your preference. You can slide the performance slider to the right to make the video processing faster, or to the left to ensure a more accurate output.</p>

	<h2>Step 3: Adjust Padding Settings</h2>
	<p>Padding refers to the number of frames added in between clips. The more padding you add, the smoother the video will appear. Adjust the padding settings to your liking before proceeding.</p>

	<h2>Step 4: Activate Montage Feature</h2>
	<p>Once you're satisfied with the performance and padding settings, activate the "Montage" feature. This will initiate the "Olympus Montage" software, which uses AI to create an impressive video montage output for you.</p>

	<h2>Step 5: Download and Share Your Video</h2>
	<p>After the video montage has been created, it will be sent to you for download. Simply download the file, and you're ready to share your stunning video with the world!</p>
